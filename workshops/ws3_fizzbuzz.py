# Write a function that prints the integers from 1 to n where n is passed to the function parameter.
#
# But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for the multiples of five print "Buzz".
# For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

# i.e fuzbuzz(15) will print out this:
# 1
# 2
# Fizz
# 4
# Buzz
# Fizz
# 7
# 8
# Fizz
# Buzz
# 11
# Fizz
# 13
# 14
# FizzBuzz
