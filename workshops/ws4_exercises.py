# Write a function translate() that will translate a text into "rövarspråket" (Swedish for "robber's language").

# Define a function is_palindrome() that recognizes palindromes (i.e. words that look the same written backwards).
# For example, is_palindrome("radar") should return True.

# Write a function is_member() that takes a value (i.e. a number, string, etc) x and a list of values a,
# and returns True if x is a member of a, False otherwise. (Note that this is exactly what the in operator does,
# but for the sake of the exercise you should pretend Python did not have this operator.)

# No. 10
# Define a function overlapping() that takes two lists and returns True if they have at least one member in common,
# False otherwise. You may use your is_member() function, or the in operator,
# but for the sake of the exercise, you should (also) write it using two nested for-loops.
